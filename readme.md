# Simple Tailwind CSS Starter

This is an extremley simple setup to develop Tailwind projects. 
Responsiveness has been optimized by using the following screen-sizes:
screens: {
    sm: '480px',
    md: '768px',
    lg: '976px',
    xl: '1440px',
},

## Usage

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Run Tailwind CLI in watch mode

```
npm run dev
```

You can use tailwind classes in any .html files in the root directory

Put any custom CSS that you may have in the **src/input.css** file

Add any config values to the **tailwind.config.js** file

To build once, run

```
npm run build
```

You only need to deploy your html files and css/style.css
